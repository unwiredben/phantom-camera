Take a picture with your Pebble watch!  Well, actually, let other people take pictures for you via Instagram.

This only works on color devices, as I didn't want to try to convert images to b/w for Aplite.

As of version 2.4, this supports the Chalk (Pebble Time Round) platform as well.  Pictures are shown centered and cropped to the edges.
