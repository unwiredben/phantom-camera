phantom-camera
==============

Based on the pebble-faces example but expanded to include a camera-like
user interface and a server component that pulls pictures from Flickr
via their search API that are taken close to the current user location.

The basic idea is that while the Pebble watch doesn't have a camera,
that shouldn't prevent a user from having a camera-like experience.
Given the number of people taking pictures all the time and posting
them online, it's likely that someone took a picture near where you are
in the past.  This app will find those pictures and show one of them
to you on the Pebble Time's 64-color screen.
